ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheNoIdeaGuy,

I'm currently working as an Infrastructure Engineer for a Managed Service Provider, I spend 95% of my time working in Azure and Office 365.

Being almost completely cloud focused as given me great opportunity to work with Microsoft products in a production environment & I need a place to store any 
current knowledge, GitHub lends itself well to the fact I am learning to manage infrastructure as code & want to share experience where possible.

I am currently learning all things IaC using the following tech:

- Bicep
- Az CLi
- PowerShell

At the same time, I'm using Azure and Office 365 as part of my day job.

There is an area called "Projects" in the KBProject Repo, which is where I store project work & add information in about the project, issues & resolutions, 
as well as lessons learned, check these out if there is any info on a task you're trying to undertake.

You can reach me on comsupport@whdomain.co.uk (my own domain, not a Company or Business)
